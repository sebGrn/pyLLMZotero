VS5SEPAF,Temporal Graph Networks for Deep Learning on Dynamic Graphs,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10637,2020-10-09,,"['EmanueleRossi', 'BenChamberlain', 'FabrizioFrasca', 'DavideEynard', 'FedericoMonti', 'MichaelBronstein']","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently become increasingly popular due to their ability to learn complex systems of relations or interactions arising in a broad spectrum of problems ranging from biology and particle physics to social networks and recommendation systems. Despite the plethora of different models for deep learning on graphs, few approaches have been proposed thus far for dealing with graphs that present some sort of dynamic nature (e.g. evolving features or connectivity over time). In this paper, we present Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), a generic, efficient framework for deep learning on dynamic graphs represented as sequences of timed events. Thanks to a novel combination of memory modules and graph-based operators, TGNs are able to significantly outperform previous approaches being at the same time more computationally efficient. We furthermore show that several previous models for learning on dynamic graphs can be cast as specific instances of our framework. We perform a detailed ablation study of different components of our framework and devise the best configuration that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several transductive and inductive prediction tasks for dynamic graphs.","['Graph Neural Networks', 'Temporal Graph Networks', 'Dynamic Graph Models', 'State-of-the-art Performance', 'Efficient Framework']"
7BPCAMGC,Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for 3D Skeleton-Based Motion Prediction,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11244,2021,,"['MaosenLi', 'SihengChen', 'YanghengZhao', 'YaZhang', 'YanfengWang', 'QiTian']","We propose a multiscale spatio-temporal graph neural network (MST-GNN) to predict the future 3D skeleton-based human poses in an action-category-agnostic manner. The core of MST-GNN is a multiscale spatio-temporal graph that explicitly models the relations in motions at various spatial and temporal scales. Different from many previous hierarchical structures, our multiscale spatio-temporal graph is built in a data-adaptive fashion, which captures nonphysical, yet motion-based relations. The key module of MST-GNN is a multiscale spatio-temporal graph computational unit (MST-GCU) based on the trainable graph structure. MST-GCU embeds underlying features at individual scales and then fuses features across scales to obtain a comprehensive representation. The overall architecture of MST-GNN follows an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder consists of a sequence of MST-GCUs to learn the spatial and temporal features of motions, and the decoder uses a graph-based attention gate recurrent unit (GA-GRU) to generate future poses. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that the proposed MST-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short and long-term motion prediction on the datasets of Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW, where MST-GNN outperforms previous works by 5.33% and 3.67% of mean angle errors in average for short-term and long-term prediction on Human 3.6M, and by 11.84% and 4.71% of mean angle errors for short-term and long-term prediction on CMU Mocap, and by 1.13% of mean angle errors on 3DPW in average, respectively. We further investigate the learned multiscale graphs for interpretability.","['MST-GNN', 'human poses', 'action-category-agnostic', 'multiscale spatio-temporal graph', 'data-adaptive']"
PEZK5F79,Machine Learning on Graphs: A Model and Comprehensive Taxonomy,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03675,2022-04-12,,"['InesChami', 'SamiAbu-El-Haija', 'BryanPerozzi', 'ChristopherRé', 'KevinMurphy']","There has been a surge of recent interest in learning representations for graph-structured data. Graph representation learning methods have generally fallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data. The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure. However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work. Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g. GraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc) into a single consistent approach. To illustrate the generality of this approach, we fit over thirty existing methods into this framework. We believe that this unifying view both provides a solid foundation for understanding the intuition behind these methods, and enables future research in the area.","['Graph Representation Learning', 'Network Embedding', 'Graph Regularized Neural Networks', 'Graph Neural Networks', 'Graph Encoder Decoder Model']"

We use agent-based modelling, a tried and true method for such endeavours, for studying the history, planned future works and possible evolution of the tram line network in the Greater Geneva region. We couple these models with knowledge graphs, in a way that both are able to mutually enrich each other. Results show that the information organisation powers of knowledge graphs are highly relevant for effortlessly recounting past events and designing scenarios to be directly incorporated inside the agent-based model. The model features all 5 tram lines from the current real-world network, servicing a total of 15 communes. In turn, the model is capable of replaying past events, predicting future developments and exploring user-defined scenarios. It also harnesses its self-organisation properties to autonomously reconstruct an artificial public transportation network for the region based on two different initial networks, servicing up to 29 communes depending on the scenario. The data gathered from the simulation is effortlessly imported back into the initial knowledge graphs. The artificial networks closely resemble their real-world counterparts and demonstrate the predictive and prescriptive powers of our agent-based model. They constitute valuable assets towards a comprehensive assessment of urban mobility systems, compelling progress for the agent-based modelling field, and a convincing demonstration of its technical capabilities.","['urban mobility', 'agent-based modelling', 'knowledge graphs', 'tram lines', 'public transportation network']"
S5JQ65CU,Self-Supervised Temporal Graph learning with Temporal and Structural Intensity Alignment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07491,2024,,"['MengLiu', 'KeLiang', 'YaweiZhao', 'WenxuanTu', 'SihangZhou', 'XinbiaoGan', 'XinwangLiu', 'KunlunHe']","Temporal graph learning aims to generate high-quality representations for graph-based tasks with dynamic information, which has recently garnered increasing attention. In contrast to static graphs, temporal graphs are typically organized as node interaction sequences over continuous time rather than an adjacency matrix. Most temporal graph learning methods model current interactions by incorporating historical neighborhood. However, such methods only consider first-order temporal information while disregarding crucial high-order structural information, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised method called S2T for temporal graph learning, which extracts both temporal and structural information to learn more informative node representations. Notably, the initial node representations combine first-order temporal and high-order structural information differently to calculate two conditional intensities. An alignment loss is then introduced to optimize the node representations, narrowing the gap between the two intensities and making them more informative. Concretely, in addition to modeling temporal information using historical neighbor sequences, we further consider structural knowledge at both local and global levels. At the local level, we generate structural intensity by aggregating features from high-order neighbor sequences. At the global level, a global representation is generated based on all nodes to adjust the structural intensity according to the active statuses on different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model S2T achieves at most 10.13% performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets.","['Temporal Graph Learning', 'Temporal Graphs', 'First-Order Temporal Information', 'High-Order Structural Information', 'Performance Improvement']"

However, many real-world systems are dynamic in nature, since the graph and node/edge attributes change over time. In recent years, GNN-based models for temporal graphs have emerged as a promising area of research to extend the capabilities of GNNs. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art of temporal GNN, introducing a rigorous formalization of learning settings and tasks and a novel taxonomy categorizing existing approaches in terms of how the temporal aspect is represented and processed. We conclude the survey with a discussion of the most relevant open challenges for the field, from both research and application perspectives.","['Graph Neural Networks', 'Temporal Graphs', 'Temporal Graph Neural Networks', 'State-of-the-art', 'Challenges']"
